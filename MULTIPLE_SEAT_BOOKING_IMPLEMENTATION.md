# Multiple Seat Booking Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented multiple seat booking functionality for the Dhaka Bus Service project, allowing passengers to book up to 4 seats in a single transaction with grouped booking management.

## Backend Implementation

### Enhanced Database Schema
- **Ticket Entity**: Added `scheduleId` and `bookingGroupId` fields for grouping multiple seat bookings
- **Multiple Booking Support**: Booking groups track multiple seats purchased together
- **SQLite Compatibility**: Fixed enum and timestamp issues for local development

### New API Endpoints
1. **POST** `/passenger/:id/tickets/multiple` - Create multiple tickets in one booking
2. **GET** `/passenger/:id/tickets/grouped` - Get passenger's grouped bookings
3. **DELETE** `/passenger/:passengerId/booking-groups/:bookingGroupId` - Cancel entire booking group
4. **GET** `/passenger/routes/available` - Get available routes for booking

### Enhanced Services
- **PassengerService**: 
  - `createMultipleTickets()` - Handle 1-4 seat bookings with validation
  - `getPassengerTicketsGrouped()` - Return bookings organized by booking groups
  - `cancelBookingGroup()` - Cancel all tickets in a booking group
- **Email Integration**: Send confirmation emails for bookings (when configured)

### DTOs and Validation
- **CreateMultipleTicketsDto**: Validates booking data for multiple seats
- **SeatBookingDto**: Individual seat selection with pricing
- **Seat Limit Validation**: Enforces 1-4 seat maximum per booking

## Frontend Implementation

### Enhanced Booking Page (`/passenger/book-ticket`)
- **5-Step Booking Process**:
  1. Select Route (from available routes)
  2. Choose Journey Date
  3. Select Bus Schedule
  4. Pick Multiple Seats (1-4 seats with visual seat map)
  5. Payment Processing

### Key Features
- **Visual Seat Map**: Interactive seat selection with availability status
- **Multiple Seat Selection**: Up to 4 seats per booking with running total
- **Real-time Validation**: Seat availability and booking limits
- **Booking Summary**: Clear display of all selected seats and total cost
- **Payment Integration**: Enhanced PaymentModal supports multiple seats

### Enhanced Dashboard (`/passenger/dashboard`)
- **Grouped Booking Display**: Shows multiple seat bookings as unified groups
- **Individual vs Group Bookings**: Separate sections for single and multiple seat bookings
- **Booking Management**: Cancel individual tickets or entire booking groups
- **Status Tracking**: Visual status indicators for different booking states
- **Trip Statistics**: Total bookings, upcoming trips, group bookings count

## API Integration

### Route Management
```typescript
// Get available routes
const routes = await routeAPI.getAvailableRoutes();

// Multiple seat booking
await ticketAPI.createMultipleTickets(passengerId, {
  scheduleId: selectedSchedule.id,
  journeyDate: selectedDate,
  seats: [
    { seatNumber: '1A', price: 450 },
    { seatNumber: '1B', price: 450 },
    { seatNumber: '2A', price: 450 }
  ]
});

// Get grouped bookings
const groupedBookings = await ticketAPI.getPassengerTicketsGrouped(passengerId);
```

### Error Handling
- **Frontend**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Backend**: Validation errors and database constraint handling
- **Authentication**: Proper token validation and role-based access

## Testing Status

### Backend Server ✅
- Running on `http://localhost:3000`
- All API endpoints registered successfully
- Database connection established
- Route creation and booking endpoints functional

### Frontend Server ✅
